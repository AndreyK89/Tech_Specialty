Loki,1,"Marvel has created a vastly different series. Hiddleston thrives, and Wilson owns this role. It may end up being Marvel's best show yet."

Alias Grace,1,It's a fantastic cast and is very well written... I was very intrigued right from the start.
The Witcher,1,"For fans of this show and newcomers, ""The Witcher"" still delivers enough escapist fun."
Cowboy Bebop,1,"It tends to resemble a random grab-bag of American and Japanese TV icons, tossed into a blender that's set on puree. But it's fast, frantic, and very funny, the animation is top-notch, and ""Lupin"" fans at least will find the characters warmly familiar."
Mare of Easttown,1,"It is a performance that will undoubtedly get [Kate Winslet] awards season recognition next year, a circuit that is familiar ground for her. But great work never gets old."

Barry,1,One of the best shows on TV is finally back.

The Boys Presents: Diabolical,1,"Ultimately, Diabolical is great if you like animation, but you won’t feel lost during The Boys if you skip it. You should still watch “John and Sun-Hee” just because it’s well told and beautifully animated."
Battlestar Galactica,1,"Well-written with some inspired production design and a great ensemble cast, I consider Battlestar Galactica one of the best sci-fi television series ever"

Big Little Lies,1,"It looks great, sounds great, and is populated with some of the best actors on a very crowded planet."
Yellowjackets,1,"One of the wildest shows of 2021! With a stellar ensemble, [Yellowjackets is] a can't miss show that will keep you guessing every week."
The Queen's Gambit,1,"Ms. Taylor-Joy is really the beginning and endgame of The Queen's Gambit, and gives a performance that is as precisely physical as it is emotional."

The White Lotus,1,Bartlett's performance is superb. [Full review in Spanish]

Chernobyl,1,"As a piece of 'entertainment' Chernobyl isn't easy going, however this well defined and complex tale is definitely worth your time. It crafts a detailed depiction of the Chernobyl disaster, while also delivering stellar performances with its able cast."
Dead End: Paranormal Park,1,Dead End: Paranormal Park is easily one of the best animated shows of the year so far. It is a fun supernatural adventure with a huge heart.
We Are Lady Parts,1,"We Are Lady Parts is an assured mix of second-generation cultural confusion and millennial feminism, one part Chewing Gum to two parts Wayne's World. Its silliness is its strength, and young and older me are thankful for it."
